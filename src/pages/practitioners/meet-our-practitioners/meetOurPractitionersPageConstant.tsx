        "Graeme Bradshaw is IMI’s founding director. With over 32 years in practice, Graeme is an experienced naturopath, homeopath, medical herbalist and nutritionist.",
        "He applies his wealth of clinical experience and extensive training in diagnostics and functional medicine to treat the root cause of your health concern.",
        "Graeme treats all ages and has a special interest in the connection between gut health and illness. He uses diagnostic testing to identify the link between digestive conditions and related symptoms that affect the mind, mood and immune system.",
        "He’s experienced in diagnosing bacterial, parasitic and fungal overgrowth, and digestive problems and food intolerances they can cause. Graeme aims to remove underlying, often hidden causes of chronic illness.",
        "“We often start by tackling digestive disorders and improving gut function. We then may remove toxins, or supplement nutritional needs. If necessary, we address stress and sleep issues, before swinging chronic problems back towards good health.”",
        "Another area of speciality for Graeme is functional medicine and testing. He uses the Organic Acids Test (OAT) to assess gut-related toxins; urinary neurotransmitters; how well mitochondria are functioning; pollution related toxicity; some nutritional imbalances.",
        "For proactive clients, Graeme recommends DNA testing; this guides the supplements and foods needed long term to protect your health as you age. It also analyses genetic predispositions for illness, identifying factors that can be managed successfully for preventative care. This allows Graeme to tailor your treatment to your specific genetic profile.",
        "Graeme studied an undergraduate in the sciences, before turning to natural medicine. He qualified in naturopathy, homeopathy, medical herbalism and nutrition in Sydney and was the first full time naturopath to practise in Hong Kong. Graeme gives seminars to doctors on one of his areas of expertise: functional medicine testing and how to manage gut issues naturally.",
        "Graeme enjoys going to the gym, hill walking, meditation, sailing, adventure travel and eating a healthy non-vegetarian diet – alongside a few coffees and a drink or two per week. He is a father of three, and now – a grandfather of three.",
